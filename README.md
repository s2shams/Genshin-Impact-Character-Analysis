# Genshin-Impact-Character-Analysis

### Main Purpose Of The Project
- Use data analysis to answer a set of questions to help create a list of 4 "must have" 5 star characters to recommend to new players.
- Create a visually pleasing dashboard to make it easy to display findings.
- Exercise webscraping and data wrangling techniques.
- Refresh Python visualization skills and become more proficient in them.
- Combine SQL, pandas and visualization tools to make everything so much easier and less complicated.

### Still Under Progress:
- Still currently collecting data related to people's opinions on individual characters through surveys (https://forms.gle/7xFsv3CDSs4Xvh6y9)
- Dashboard is still in the making, you can view it [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGFhNmIzNWMtYjY1NS00Njc5LTgyZmItNDgwZWNmNTRkMDc5IiwidCI6IjBjOGRkM2YwLTgwZGYtNDgyMi04ZWZmLTBhNjdhMTUyNTk3NiJ9).

### Future Goals Of The Project:
- Automate all repetitive tasks to make code more efficient and run fast.
- Gain feedback from the community and update the data/visuals with community feedback.
- Update the datasets to include newly released characters.

### Info
- All the datasets were webscraped from genshinlab.com and paimon.moe
- Since it's impossible to know the distribution of revenue between the characters in a double banner, a ratio from the global wish tracker on paimon.moe was used to estimate the indivual character revenue.

### Folders
- Notebooks: Contains all the jupyter notebooks used in the project.
- Dashboard: This contains the dashboard bluprints of each page.
- Images: This contains all images used in the project/dashboard. This includes elemental backgrounds and also character images.
- Raw: Contains all the rough/preprocessed data and analysis.
